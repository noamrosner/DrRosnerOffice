 The program will iritate through the rows and will send each patient a reminder.
     The program will open WhatsApp and send the messages, each message containg the relevant information as specified in the code, the patient's name, the date and time of the appointment and other relevant information.  
     
 The program can handle with issues that can be caused from the user's behavior and bad input.
 The program will notify at the end if some users haven't recieved the reminder and will alert what caused the specific issue.  
 
 The program is written in Python, using "openpyxl" for handling with XLSX file, "tkinter" for the UI and "pywhatkit" for sending WhatsApp messages.
