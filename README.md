# Doctor's Office Automation

Created severaloffice automations to make the work in the office easier.

Including:
- WhatsApp Appotiment Reminder

   The office is working with several Excel files (xlsx) to handle appointemts for procedures and for regular appointments in the office.
   The program is a simple minimal window with several buttons for each of the different reminder options.
   The secretary can press on the wanted button and choose the file containting the relevant information.
   
   The program will open WhatsApp and send the messages, each message containg the relevant information as specified in the code, the patient's name, the date and time of the appointment and other relevant information.
