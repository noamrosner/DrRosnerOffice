   The office is working with several Excel files (xlsx) to handle appointemts for procedures and for regular appointments in the office.
   The program is a simple minimal window with several buttons for each of the different reminder options.
   The secretary can press on the wanted button and choose the file containting the relevant information.
   
   The program will open WhatsApp and send the messages, each message containg the relevant information as specified in the code, the patient's name, the date and time of the appointment and other relevant information.
   


- Breath Results Automation

   The results are seen in an Excel file (xlsx), the program can go over the file while printing the relevant information for analysis.
   The program will add the Doctor's recommendation and the signature in the appropriate place.
